# Summary
This roadmap will lead the m4m-domotics team toward the next MakerFaire Rome 2019.

Discussion about this topic is started in real-world and will continue here as pull-request.

# Space requirements
For MakerFaire 2019 we would like to ask for a larger space: a single slot 4x2m was too small for both domotics systems and VR. If we will have two slots, we may use a slot to recreate a small home (in scale), and the other slot for one or two VR locations.

# Proposals
The current project needs still some work to be stable and complete, but most of the job is done: a real domotics environment that can be controlled by both a web page and virtual reality. We need to agree about the direction we should move forward to and which features we should add.

## Core technology
We should keep stick to our value proposition that is something like: an integrated system that blends together domotics and virtual reality.

In other words, we should find the way to exploit the potential of controlling a real environment from the web and virtual reality. Although solutions as Augmented Reality or immersive pictures/videos can be powerful add-ons, should not become in the short-term the main target.

## Target audience
We would like to keep addressing workers (eg. installation technicians) and/or general audience (eg. family) at the moment.

We would like to avoid to specialize the project towards a pure security system (eg. anti-theft system) or for people with disability.

## Installation technicians
This was the very first use case for this project, and we may stay on this track adding following features:
- transparent walls to see wires and pipes inside th walls
- electric or water flows through wires and pipes
- absorbed power overlay (eg. on appliances)
- etc.

The technician can inspect and interact with the home remotely, to allow very fast first aid and in order to better prepare the in-person maintenance.

## Live webcams
An important feature we would like to add is the stream from live webcams. Video can be displayed on both web panel and in VR. For VR, a 180Â° camera would be a better option.


## Integration with other home automation systems
We should push integration with other systems like Google Home, Amazon Alexa or Apple Home. These technology are quite low-budget and easy to interface with, we could invest some money and time for their integration with potentially high returns.

Actually, we may take a lot of inspiration from existing solutions. For example, we may reproduce an Apple Home like system and add the virtual reality to control the home; it would be a very nice achievement.

## Integration with robotics projects of our school
Our school is carrying on also some very interesting projects in robotics. M4M Domotics may be integrated with robotics ones, opening new perspectives.

## Support for other VR systems
Oculus Rift is great but it is quite expensive, uncomfortable to carry around, and it is a proprietary technology. Would be nice to experiment on other devices, like Oculus Go/Quest, Cardboards, and other open-source systems. 

## Industry 4.0
We could convert our technology for industry 4.0, replacing the home with a factory. This would be particularly useful in combination with the integration with our robotics projects.

## Drones
Well, drones are so cool. Why do not include them in M4M Domotics?

## Events & Emotion
This concept starts from the idea that the main point of using VR is to increase the emotional involvement of the user. Then, we could think to the following use case:
- there is a real-life event, eg. end of year party of our school, or the Maker Faire itself
- people that cannot attend in person to this event, may connect through VR (not necessarily Oculus Rift)
- people connected through VR may interact with the real environment through lights, led, or a huge roller shutter: each remote user accounts for only a bit of the overall system (for example, a single led or some millimeters up of the roller shutter), and only the joint effort of all the connected people can achieve the full goal (eg. turn-on all the leds or completely open the shutter). Cheers!

## B&B remote control
Owner of B&B may want to check the status of their properties, and possibly control them remotely.
